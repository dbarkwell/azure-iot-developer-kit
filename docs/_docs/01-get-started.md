## Configure Wi-Fi

IoT projects rely on internet connectivity. Use the following instructions to configure the DevKit to connect to Wi-Fi.

1. Hold down button B, push and release the reset button, and then release button B. Your IoT DevKit enters AP mode for configuring the Wi-Fi connection. The screen displays the service set identifier (SSID) of the IoT DevKit and the configuration portal IP address:
    ![Reset button, button B, and SSID]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/wifi-ap.jpg" | absolute_url }})
    ![Enter AP mode]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/set-ap-mode.gif" | absolute_url }})

2. Use a Web browser on a different Wi-Fi enabled device (computer or mobile phone) to connect to the IoT DevKit SSID displayed in the previous step. If it asks for a password, leave it empty.

## Prepare the development environment

We recommend [Azure IoT Tools](https://aka.ms/azure-iot-tools) extension pack for Visual Studio Code to develop on the DevKit. The Azure IoT Tools contains [Azure IoT Device Workbench](https://aka.ms/iot-workbench) to develop and debug on various IoT devkit devices and [Azure IoT Hub Toolkit](https://aka.ms/iot-toolkit) to manage and interact with Azure IoT Hub.

You can watch these [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) videos to have overview about what they do:
* [Introduction to the new IoT Workbench extension for VS Code](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/IoT-Workbench-extension-for-VS-Code)
* [What's new in the IoT Toolkit extension for VS Code](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/Whats-new-in-the-IoT-Toolkit-extension-for-VS-Code)

Follow these steps to prepare the development environment for DevKit:

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). It provides the necessary toolchain for compiling and uploading Arduino code.
    * **Windows**: Use Windows Installer version. Do not install from the app store.
    * **macOS**: Drag and drop the extracted **Arduino.app** into `/Applications` folder.
    * **Ubuntu**: Unzip it into folder such as `$HOME/Downloads/arduino-1.8.8`

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a cross platform source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

3. Launch VS Code, look for **Arduino** in the extension marketplace and install it. This extension provides enhanced experiences for developing on Arduino platform.
    ![Install Arduino]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/install-arduino.png" | absolute_url }})

4. Look for **Azure IoT Tools** in the extension marketplace and install it.
    ![Install Azure IoT Tools]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/install-azure-iot-tools.png" | absolute_url }})

5. Configure VS Code with Arduino settings.

    In Visual Studio Code, click **File > Preference > Settings**. 

    ![Open settings]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/setting-1.png" | absolute_url }})

    Type "Arduino" in the search textbox, the **Arduino:Additional Urls** is showed up, then click the hyperlink '**Edit in settings.json**'.
    ![Find settings]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/setting-2.png" | absolute_url }})

    Make sure the ```"arduino.path"``` and ```"arduino.additionalUrls"``` have been set correctly, if not please add following lines to configure Arduino depending on your platform: 

    * **Windows**:

        ```json
        "arduino.path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Arduino",
        "arduino.additionalUrls": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VSChina/azureiotdevkit_tools/master/package_azureboard_index.json"
        ```

    * **macOS**:

        ```json
        "arduino.path": "/Applications",
        "arduino.additionalUrls": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VSChina/azureiotdevkit_tools/master/package_azureboard_index.json"
        ```

    * **Ubuntu**:

        Replace the **{username}** placeholder below with your username.

        ```json
        "arduino.path": "/home/{username}/Downloads/arduino-1.8.8",
        "arduino.additionalUrls": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VSChina/azureiotdevkit_tools/master/package_azureboard_index.json"
        ```
   Restart Visual Studio Code
   
6. Click `F1` to open the command palette, type and select **Arduino: Board Manager**. Search for **AZ3166** and install the latest version.
    ![Install DevKit SDK]({{"/assets/images/getting-started/install-az3166-sdk.png" | absolute_url }})

### Install ST-Link drivers

[ST-Link/V2](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) is the USB interface that IoT DevKit uses to communicate with your development machine. Follow the OS-specific steps to allow the machine access to your device.

* **Windows**: Download and install USB driver from [STMicroelectronics website](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
* **macOS**: No driver is required for macOS.
* **Ubuntu**: Run the following in terminal and log out and log in for the group change to take effect:
    ```bash
    # Copy the default rules. This grants permission to the group 'plugdev'
    sudo cp ~/.arduino15/packages/AZ3166/tools/openocd/0.10.0/linux/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

    # Add yourself to the group 'plugdev'
    # Logout and log back in for the group to take effect
    sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $(whoami)
    ```
